This resource page contains many examples of picture-and-word work sheets intended for use in speech-language pathology intervention.

The sheets were made in Microsoft Word, using copyright-free pictures from Microsoft Clip Art and Media and converted into portable document files (pdfs) with Adobe Acrobat.

The vocabulary represents (non-rhotic) Australian English pronunciation, and although most of the words and minimal pairs will 'work' in other dialects of English you may need to discard some. For example, pairs like saw-shore, and spa-star are minimal pairs in Australian English and in other non-rhotic varieties of English, but not in rhotic dialects such as Canadian, Irish, Scottish and most US 'Englishes'.

SLPs/SLTs and students are invited to use these worksheets and other resources when working with children with speech sound disorders. You are free to save them to your computer and to customize them to suit individual clients and to fit your service delivery model. Restrictions that apply to their use are stated in the copyright notice.

On this page you will find pictures and words for minimal pairs in which the contrasts are maximally or nearly maximally opposed. There are more minimal pair and near minimal pair pictures here and here.

How many exemplars?
There are many pictures to choose from here, but in selecting target words for phonological therapy it is definitely not a case of 'more is better'. Elbert, Powell and Swartzlander (1991) found that they could teach as few as 3 to 5 minimal pairs in order for their participants to show spontaneous generalisation to other words containing the target sounds.

Place-Voice-Manner Chart
Consonants are classified in terms of their place of articulation, manner of articulation and voicing. The chart at the foot of this page is a PVM Chart showing the consonants of English. The voiced glide /w/ is included twice because it has two places of articulation, bilabial and velar. The glottal stop is also there because it occurs in some dialects of English.

Place of Articulation
Consonants are made by obstructing or constricting airflow at some point in the vocal tract. The point of obstruction or constriction is called the place of articulation. The ‘places’ of articulation are Bilabial, Labiodental, Interdental, Alveolar, Palatal, Velar and Glottal. Note that there are other classification systems that differ slightly.

Manner of Articulation
Consonants are classified in terms of their Place-Manner-Voice. The manner of articulation is the type of obstruction that occurs in the production of a particular consonant. The ‘manners’ of articulation are: Stop, Fricative, Affricate, Nasal, Liquid and Glide. The Stops, Fricatives and Affricates are termed obstruents, and the Nasals, Liquids, Glides, AND VOWELS are termed sonorants. The consonants /l/, /r/, /w/ and /j/ are also referred to as approximants.

Non-Major Class Distinctions
The Non-Major Class Distinctions are in place: differentiating labial, coronal and dorsal consonants; in manner: differentiating stops, fricatives, affricates, nasals, liquids, glides; and in voice: differentiating the voiced-voiceless cognate pairs.

Major Class Features
Major Class Features distinguish between the main groupings of sounds in a language: consonants vs. vowels, glides vs. consonants, and obstruents (stops, fricatives, and affricates) vs. sonorants (nasals, liquids, glides, and vowels).

Bake-make illustrates a major class distinction between obstruents and sonorants; make-wake illustrates the major class distinction between consonants and glides.

In the minimal pair silly-billy the contrast is not quite maximal, but it is ‘maximal enough’ to be highly salient for a child receiving intervention. In silly-billy we have labial /b/ vs. coronal /s/, stop /b / vs. fricative /s/, voiced /b/ vs. voiceless /s/, and unmarked /b/ vs. marked /s/. It crosses many featural dimensions but /b/ and /s/ are obstruents so there is no obstruent vs. sonorant opposition (i.e., no Major Class Feature distinction).

Maximal Opposition
A maximal opposition cuts across many featural dimensions. For example the word pair bun-sun differs in place (labial is distinct from coronal), manner (stop is distinct from fricative) and voice (/b/ is voiced and /s/ is voiceless). The contrast fat-gnat is in place, manner, voice and major class (/f/ is an obstruent and /n/ is sonorant), and markedness (/f/ is marked, /n/ is not).

Target Selection and Maximal Oppositions
"Known" vs. maximally distinct "unknown" sound
In the Maximal Oppositions approach (Gierut, 1989, 2001, 2007) Minimal Pair therapy the treatment sets consists of words that are minimally contrasted and which have maximal or near maximal feature differences between each word pair. One word in a pair represents a sound the child "knows" (can say at word level) and the other represents a sound the child does not know (cannot say).

For example, a child may "know" /m/ and be able to say words like man, mat and mine. However, the same child may be unable to say /f/ as in fan, fat and fine. The consonants /f/ and /m/ are maximally opposed as follows.

Non-Major Class Distinctions
Place NO - /m/ and /f/ are both labial, however /m/ is bilabial and /f/ is labiodental
Voice YES - /m/ is voiced and /f/ is voiceless
Manner YES - /m/ is nasal and /f/ is fricative
Major Class Features
Obstruent vs. Sonorant YES - /m/ is sonorant and /f/ is obstruent
Markedness
Unmarked (simple) vs. Marked (complex) YES - /m/ is unmarked and /f/ is marked

/m/ vs. /f/ SIWI
man fan mat fat mine fine mail fail meat feet meal feel money funny make fake mix fix mole foal mountain fountain mate fête maid fade

Employing this target selection strategy, Gierut and co-workers have demonstrated widespread cross-system generalisation in suitable children with phonological disorder.
